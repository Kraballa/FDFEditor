ABOUT v 1.1
-----------
This is a toolbox for modding the Touhou fangame "東方幕華祭 春雪篇 ～ Fantastic Danmaku Festival Part II".
It can edit most files from the first game aswell.

Repository at "https://github.com/Kraballa/FDFEditor"

If you don't know what you're doing, take a look at the modding guide for some pointers and study the game files yourself.
Sometimes it might be required to take a look at the games code to figure out what something does.

This program was made with the intent of easing the modding of the games Data files found in the Content/Data folder.
Since they're encrypted and sometimes very hard to read from plain text alone, this tool provides some additional view(s)
like one for editing pattern files.

If you at some point accidentally break your game, delete the edited files that cause issues, go to steam, right click
the game > Properties > Local Files > Verify Integrity of Game Files. If that doesn't work, backup your save files and replays
and reinstall the game.

Some more assumptions this program makes:
-all files are stored in a valid format that the game can read
-all .xna files are encrypted, all other files are in plain text. Check out Tools > Decrypt/Encrypt in other cases

Planned aditions:
-options tab to select keys in detail. This would enable decrypting all resources.
-some kind of logging system to see what changes have been made
-some kind of backup system in case a change breaks the game
-ctrl + w -> close current tab
-option for backing up files before starting to edit them.

Current Usability Issues:
-no warning when closing unsaved changes
-closing tabs is still clunky, although closing all tabs is easy now

THIS TOOL WAS MADE WITH GOOD INTENTIONS. DO NOT USE IT FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. I WILL TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ANY LEGAL ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST YOU.
