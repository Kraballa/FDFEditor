-----------
This is a toolbox for modding the Touhou fangame "東方幕華祭 春雪篇 ～ Fantastic Danmaku Festival Part II".
I currently can't edit files of the first title in the series.

It was made with the intent of easing the modding of the games Data files found in the Content/Data folder.
Since they're encrypted and very hard to read from plain text alone, this tool provides some additional view(s)
like one for editing pattern files.

THIS TOOL WAS MADE WITH GOOD INTENTIONS. DO NOT USE IT FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. I WILL TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ANY LEGAL ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST YOU BECAUSE OF THIS TOOLBOX.
