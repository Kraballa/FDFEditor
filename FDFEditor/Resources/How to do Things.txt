How to do Things:
A step by step guide on how to start editing files.

1. Under "Game" select the game you're going to be editing. Either the Steam versions of FDF1 and 2, or the prerelease found on sites like Moriyashrine or Touhouwiki.

2. Think about what you want to edit. Dialogue? Bullet patterns? Stages? Go to "Help > Modding Guide" and look at the file table to find out what files contain the respective data.
If you want to edit images, use "Tool > Decrypt" and save as ".png". Use the image editing software of your choice and reencrypt using "Tool > Encrypt".
Remember that the "Game" and "Key" options are used both for de- and encryption, so use the right ones when saving! 

3. Under "Key" select the index of the decryption key depending on what files you want to edit. If you don't know which, try them all and see what works.
-Key 0: FDF1 Bullet Patterns, FDF1 & 2 Graphics
-Key 2: FDF2 all files inside the "Content/Data" folder, FDF1 dialogue.
I don't know if it's the same with the non-steam version.

4. Make changes and save the file wherever you found it.
